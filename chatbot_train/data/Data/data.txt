The Illinois Condominium Property Act (765 ILCS 605) requires a condo association to collect assessments from owners. Failure to do this could result in a lawsuit against the association. Sometimes, an owner might fail to pay due to a hardship. In this case, the association must still collect assessments regardless of the board’s personal feelings about the owner’s situation.
What steps can a condominium association take to collect assessments when an owner fails to pay on time
Once a condo owner fails to pay assessments to the association, the association has several options. It can: Send a 30-day notice; File a lien on the property; or File an eviction action.

If a unit owner does not respond to the notice, the next step is to file a lien against the unit. You should speak with an attorney to assist you with this process. A lien allows the association to force the sale of the unit. The proceeds of the sale then pay off what the unit owner owes.

IMPROPER USE of utilities OR UTILITY TAP
If you suspect that there is a utility tap, you should contact your landlord. Under Illinois law, landlords must inform a tenant if the tenant is responsible for direct payment to the utility company for any service to common areas or other units. Without such notice, the landlord will be responsible for compensating the tenant and removing the tap. Utility companies must ensure that your utilities are not stolen. You can ask the utility company to investigate within 30 days after you receive the bill. After the utility company inspects the meter, they should issue a report determining the presence of the utility tap. The report should indicate whether the landlord benefits from the usage of the utility service. Make sure you save this report. Contact the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) at (800) 524-0795, if the utility company does not inspect the claim.
what proofs an utility company must have to show illegal tap
The utility company may charge the customer who received service from the illegal tap. The utility company must prove that: Tampering has occurred with the utility's wires, pipes, meters, or other service equipment;; The customer has benefitted from the tampering; and
The utility's billing is reasonable;; If the utility company fails to take action, you should file a complaint with the ICC regarding the over billing.
what time should PUBLIC UTILITY COMPANIES Take FOR RECONNECTING SERVICES
Once you have fixed the problems for the shut-off or provided a valid medical certificate, the utility company must timely turn on your service. If the utility company does not meet the time limits, you may not have to pay a reconnection fee.If the delay is for 2 or more calendar days and was not your fault, the utility must credit your account: Two non-prorated monthly charges, or Three non-prorated monthly charges if the shut off was a mistake.
when there is no time limit for reconnecting services
The time limits do not apply if: You do not give the utility company access to reconnect the service;; The shut-off happened at place other than the meter as a result of lack of access;; Repair is needed to correct damage or an unsafe condition; or Unforeseen reasons cause delay.

can i become THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY BY USING IT FOR A LONG TIME
Probably. It takes 20 years to acquire legal title to real estate by adverse possession. If your possession has really been “adverse,” you own it.

But, not just any 20 years of possession. Illinois courts require 5 essential ingredients. Your possession must be: “(1) continuous, (2) hostile or adverse, (3) actual, (4) open, notorious, and exclusive possession of the premises, (5) under claim of title inconsistent with that of the true owner.”

The association can also collect the legal fees incurred to recover the delinquent assessments. Unless the purchaser is a mortgage holder (i.e., the bank), the purchaser of the foreclosed unit pays the delinquent assessments and legal fees. It has recently become more common for the mortgage holder to purchase the unit. If this happens, the association will have to wait until the mortgage holder sells the unit. 
HOW IS A CONTRACT FOR DEED USED FOR BUYING A HOUSE
A contract for deed is a way to buy a house. It’s an alternative to a mortgage sale—usually, because the buyer can’t get a mortgage. A mortgage sale has three sides: buyer, seller, and lender.

A contract for deed has just two sides: buyer and seller. The buyer pays the seller, for at least several years. Once the contract has been paid off, the seller delivers to the buyer a title to the property.
CAN A CONTRACTOR PUT A MECHANICS LIEN ON MY HOUSE
The contractor should have told you about the mechanics lien. The law says they’re supposed to, but not doing that probably doesn’t make the lien invalid. One way or another, to undo the lien you’ll have to resolve the charge being disputed. The Mechanics Lien Act has been around since 1825, and helps contractors get paid for making improvements to property. A mechanics lien provides security, or collateral, for a debt. The lien makes the property that was worked on collateral for the debt. If the property owner doesn’t pay, the contractor could go after the property. In theory, a mechanics lien can be foreclosed upon just like a mortgage.

CAN DRONES BE FLOWN OVER OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY
The law is developing and in its early stages. Even where it’s not an illegal discharge of a firearm, shooting down a drone would be testing the limits. The recent column said a property owner could cut branches that hang over onto their property, from a tree whose trunk is completely on a neighbor’s property. That right to “self-help” traces back to a basic principle of Roman law that the property owner’s legal rights extend “ad coelum et ad inferos.” While commonly translated as “to the heavens and to hell,” some picky classicists say “hell” embellishes it--”inferos” just means “below.”

how to GET THE bond for TITLE FOR MY MOBILE HOME
Follow the Secretary of State’s “bond for title” procedures. You complete some paperwork, give them a bond, and they give you a title. After 3 years, if nobody shows up claiming the mobile home was theirs, you get the bond back. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work, in theory. Even in theory, the process isn’t quick, easy, or cheap. But it’s the only way to get title if a transfer from the original seller is missing. Mobile homes are classified as motor vehicles under Illinois law. Therefore, just like cars, mobile homes have certificates of title. When a mobile home is sold, its title is supposed to be transferred, just like in a car sale.

how JUDGMENT LIEN become a lien AGAINST REAL ESTATE
In Illinois, an unpaid judgment can become a lien on real estate. A judgment lien allows a creditor to force a sale of property owned by the debtor (you). The money from the sale of the property is then used to pay off the judgment. A creditor can also ask the court to have the property sold by the sheriff, even without a judgment lien. To get a judgment lien, the creditor must file certain documents in the county recorder's office.
what are the effects of lien
A lien attaches to real estate that you own. In Illinois, a court judgment must first be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds in the county where the property is located. The creditor must record the judgment even if the property is located in the same county where the judgment was entered. Then, a creditor with a judgment lien may be able to force you to sell your property to pay off the judgment. They can do this even if you owe other creditors money.
what is the role of Foreclosing on the lien
If the creditor decides to enforce the judgment lien, he will do a title search on the property to find any other liens on the property. The parties with those liens will also be named as defendants in the foreclosure complaint so they can resolve their claims. After filing with the court, the creditor must serve all defendants with a summons and a copy of the complaint. The complaint will contain: Information regarding the judgment lien;; A request for a judgment of foreclosure;; A request for a judicial sale of the property plus costs.
what are redemption rights
Even where the creditor has forced a sale of the real estate, you have the right to buy back the property. You can do this within 6 months from the date of sale. To buy back the property, you need to pay the amount the buyer paid for the property plus 10% interest. These funds are paid to the creditor or buyer. You will receive a certificate of redemption which you should record with the county’s Recorder of Deeds. The certificate of redemption cancels the sale and make your recovery of the property official.
when to file a Motion for turnover
As mentioned above, a creditor can ask the court to have the sheriff sell your property without a judgment lien. A judgment creditor can file a Motion for Turnover of Real Property to satisfy the judgment. This means that if the motion is granted by the court, your property is turned over for sale by the sheriff without the expense or delay of a foreclosure or lien. Motions for Turnover are not used often, and have these requirements: The judgment debt must be greater than your equity interest. Equity interest refers to the value of the home minus what you owe on the home. For example, if your home is worth $100,000 and you have a mortgage for $70,000, your equity interest is $30,000;;The creditor must repay any mortgages on the property before keeping any proceeds from the sale;;If the property being turned over is your primary residence, it is subject to the Homestead Exemption discussed below.
what is function of homestead exemption body
In Illinois, the Homestead Exemption stops your primary home from being sold to satisfy the lien if your equity interest in the home is less than the exemption amount. The value amount of the exemption is $15,000 for a single person and $30,000 for a married couple who own the home together. If the equity interest is less than the exemption amount, there cannot be a forced sale of the house. For example, if your home is worth $85,000, but you owe $75,000 on the mortgage, your equity interest is $10,000. This is less than the $15,000 exemption limit, so your home is exempt from a forced sale.
What is surplus in foreclosure
In a foreclosure, your house or condominium can be sold to pay what you still owe on your mortgage. If your property sells for more than the amount you owe on your home, this extra money is called a surplus. Collecting a surplus generally ends the foreclosure. Once the surplus is given out, you will not be able to appeal the foreclosure. If you think the foreclosure was wrong, talk to a lawyer before filing any papers to collect your surplus
Who can get a surplus
The owner of the house or condominium can collect the surplus. You do not have to hire anyone to help you with a surplus. The entire process is based on forms that you can fill out. Even if you hire a lawyer, you will still have to sign the forms, appear in court with your photo ID, and collect the surplus check when it is ready. There are very few exceptions to this. These rules are in place to protect you from dishonest people who try to take a percentage of the surplus or steal the surplus by pretending to be you. If the person's total estate was less than $100,000, including the surplus, you may be able to avoid opening a probate estate. When the estate is less than $100,000 you can use a Small Estate Affidavit instead of going through probate. You probably do not need to hire a lawyer if this is the case.
How do I know if I have a surplus
If there is a surplus after your property is sold, the foreclosing attorney or officer will send you a Notice of Surplus. This is usually sent to the foreclosed property address unless you have given the court a new address. If you don't get a notice, or you received it but can't find it now, you can still find out whether there was a surplus in your case. To find out if there is a surplus, go to the circuit clerk's office in your county. You must bring identification and fill out a form to be allowed to look at the file. You will need your case number (it appears in the top right corner of all your court papers). When you get the court file, look for the Report of Sale. 
what to do to get surplus
After there is a final order of foreclosure, you can petition the court for the surplus funds. You must fill out a Petition to Turnover Surplus Funds, and any other forms required by the court, and file them with the circuit clerk. After you have filled out the paperwork, you must wait 30 days until the foreclosure on your property has been finalized. Once there has been a final judgment on your foreclosure, you are able to send in your forms to get any surplus.
Does it matter if I filed a bankruptcy in the past
If you have filed a bankruptcy, it is possible that your creditors might claim a right to some of your surplus funds. You should discuss your surplus with your bankruptcy lawyer. If your bankruptcy case has already been closed, you may have to reopen your bankruptcy case.
how to Avoid scams
If you do want a lawyer, be careful. There are many people who will try to take advantage of you by charging to collect your surplus. Many of these are not lawyers and are operating illegally. Others are lawyers who may not be doing a very good job.If you do hire a lawyer, you should only hire a lawyer who offers to do the work for a reasonable hourly fee, a flat fee or no fee. Never pay a fee that is a percentage of your surplus. If they charge you a fee, they should give you a written contract that clearly explains your rights and responsibilities and how you will be billed.

CAN SOMEONE USE A JUDICIAL LIEN TO FORECLOSE ON MY HOUSE
In theory, maybe. In practice, no. Creditors almost never sell someone’s house to repay a debt. You don’t have much to worry about. That, at least, is true for debts that weren’t used to buy the house. It’s different with mortgages. That’s because a mortgage is a voluntary lien, that you agree to. You don’t agree to the lien that results from a court judgment in a regular collection case. It’s involuntary. The homestead exemption discussed in a recent column is one complication. For someone who’s single, it exempts from collection $15,000 of equity in their residence. Married couples double that protection to $30,000.
